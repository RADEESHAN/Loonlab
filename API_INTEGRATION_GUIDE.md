## Testing the API Integration

### Prerequisites

1. You need a valid API key from TMDb (The Movie Database)
   - Sign up at [https://www.themoviedb.org/signup](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup)
   - Request an API key at [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

### Setup and Configuration

1. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend application**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. **Configure your API key**
   - Navigate to the Admin page in the application
   - Enter your TMDb API key in the provided field
   - Click "Update API Key"
   - Use the testing tools to verify the API connection

### Testing Process

1. **Verify API Connection**
   - On the Admin page, check the API Status section
   - The "API Key Configured" should show "Yes" in green
   - Click "Test API Key" to verify that the API is working

2. **Test Popular Movies**
   - Navigate to the Home page
   - The page should load with a list of popular movies
   - Check that images are loading correctly with the shimmer effect

3. **Test Search Functionality**
   - Use the search bar to search for movies
   - Verify that results appear and infinite scrolling works
   - Try searching for a very specific movie to test accuracy

4. **Test Movie Details**
   - Click on any movie to view its details
   - Verify that additional information and videos load correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No movies loading**
   - Check that your API key is valid (Admin page > Test API Key)
   - Verify network connectivity to TMDb API
   - Check browser console for error messages

2. **Images not loading**
   - The application has fallbacks for missing images
   - If many images fail, check your network connection
   - Verify that the TMDb image CDN is not blocked by your network

3. **Search not working**
   - Check API key status
   - Try simple search terms first
   - Verify that the backend server is running

### Error Messages

The application has been enhanced to provide specific error messages for different scenarios:

- **Invalid API key**: Update your API key in the Admin page
- **Network errors**: Check your internet connection
- **Server errors**: The backend server might be down or experiencing issues

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching for API responses
   - Optimize image loading further with responsive sizes

2. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add more filtering options for movie searches
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

3. **Feature Additions**
   - Add user reviews
   - Implement recommendations based on viewing history
