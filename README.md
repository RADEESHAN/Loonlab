## API Key Instructions
To use this application with real movie data, you need a valid TMDb API key:

### Getting a TMDb API Key
1. Register at [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) (free)
2. After confirming your email, go to your account settings â†’ API
3. Follow the steps to request an API key (choose "Developer" option)
4. Generate a new API key (v3 auth)

### Setting Up Your API Key
You have two options for configuring your API key:

#### Option 1: Via the Admin Page (Recommended)
1. Start both the backend and frontend servers
2. Open the application in your browser
3. Navigate to the Admin page by clicking "Admin" in the navigation bar
4. Enter your TMDb API key in the input field
5. Click "Update API Key"
6. Use the "Test API Key" button to verify the connection
7. Return to the homepage to see real movie data

#### Option 2: Via the Backend .env File
1. Open the `backend/.env` file
2. Replace the placeholder API key with your real TMDb API key:
   ```
   MOVIE_API_KEY=your_actual_tmdb_api_key_here
   ```
3. Save the file and restart the backend server

**IMPORTANT**: Without a valid API key, the application will use mock data. The default API key in the project is just a placeholder and won't connect to TMDb's servers.

### Troubleshooting API Issues
If you're experiencing issues with the API connection:
1. Test your API key in the Admin section
2. Check your internet connection
3. Verify that your TMDb API key is active and valid
